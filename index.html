<h2 class="text1"> Lesson of the 4 operations </h2>
<p>The four operations of mathematics are mathematical functions which take input values (that is, numbers) and convert them into output values (again, that’s another number). 
They are: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The four operations are considered to be the cornerstone of mathematics, and as such, they’re an important part of maths lessons at school. 
Children might also be introduced to basic maths operations in learning environments at EYFS level.

It's important for children to become confident with using the four operations so that they can build on those basic skills in real life and in future maths lessons.

<h1> addition</h1>
<p>In maths, the addition of two numbers results in the sum of those numbers together. Addition is represented by the ‘+’ (plus) symbol, and it’s usually the first of the four operations that children learn about in school.

In Key Stage 1, children are introduced to addition in the form of counting. Teachers might use number lines, other basic visual aids, or concrete materials like blocks to support children with addition.
</p></p>
<h1>Subtraction</h1>
<p>Subtraction is the process of taking the value of 1 number away from another. It’s represented by the ‘-’ (minus) symbol.

Subtraction is usually the second mathematical operation that children learn about at school, after addition. And, like addition, it’s often explained in terms of counting.
 Subtraction is like counting backwards. Children can also use number lines and concrete materials to visualise and understand subtraction.
</p>
<h1>Multiplication</h1>
<p>Multiplication is most often represented by the symbol ‘x’ (times), particularly at primary school. As a mathematical operation, multiplication can be thought of as repeated addition, especially when children are first beginning to learn about multiplication.

Teachers can also use a number line to introduce this concept, which is also similar to skip counting. Children will see that adding numbers to each other in equal 'jumps' takes them to the right answer for multiplication problems.</p>
<h1>Division</h1>
<p>Division is often described as the reverse of multiplication.
 It involves dividing or splitting one number into equal parts, and is most often represented in primary school by the ‘÷’ symbol.

Like multiplication, children are often introduced to division in the form of word problems. After this, they’ll move on to simple division problems, typically ones that involve halving. By the end of key stage 1, children should be comfortable with solving problems involving division, including those in context.</p>

<div class="text2"><h3><span>A</span>ddition examples<h3> 
<p>For example, let’s say that Jimmy has 2 apples and Laura has 3 apples, and that we want to find out how many apples they have together.
 By adding them together, we see that both of them combined have 5 apples (2 Jimmy’s apples + 3 Laura’s apples = 5 apples in total.
 2+3=5</p>
 <h3><span>S</span>ubtraction</h3>
 <p>For example, Maggie has 5 apples.
 She gives 2 apples to her friend, Paul.
 How many apples does she have? She has 3 apples (5 apples that she had – 2 apples that she gave to Paul = 3 apples that are left to her: 5-2=3</p>
 <h3><span>M</span>ultiplication<h3>
 <p>Think of it like this: You have 5 groups of apples and each group has 3 apples. 
 One of the ways you can find out how many apples you have is this one:
3 apples + 3 apples + 3 apples + 3 apples + 3 apples = 15 apples in total
You can see that it is way too much work (especially if you have larger numbers), so you can use multiplication to solve this problem:
5 group of apples x 3 apples in every group = 15 apples in total:
5*3=15
 </p>
 <h3><span>D</span> ivision<h3>
 <p>For example, you have 12 apples that need to be shared equally between 4 people.
 So, how many apples will each person get? Each person will get 3 apples (12 apples / 4 people = 3 apples per person). 
 The division is the opposite of multiplication:12/4=3
